# About embeddedInn

Embeddedinn is the place where I keep a tab on the technical tinkering and professional work that I do on a day to day basis. It is more of a journal of activities than a full fledged tutorial site. However, I try to put in as many details as possible so that it will benefit others trying to do something similar. 
Visit the tutorials page to access my in-depth tutorials on various technical topics. 


# about me

I am an embedded systems developer by profession. The current day job primarily revolves around product management, design, development, and integration of drivers, system software, compilers, and programming tools for secure networked embedded processors and modules. In the past, building and integrating wireless video streaming solutions, in-home shared TV experiences, Linux device drivers for STBs, and USB drivers for mobile devices fetched my bread and butter.

I started my career with FPGA based system modeling and synthesis and timing closure of some HDL modules and at times got my hands dirty with some process node migration work for PDKs. This got me interested in working at the boundary of hardware and software and designing for both sides. Exploring the possibilities took me to various levels of the stack including UI design and build management. I even did some server-side development and web design for a while. I am a tinkerer and I get a kick out of exploring the root level functional understanding of things and enjoys exponential integration upwards from there. In the last couple of years, secure product development and program management have caught my fascination.

My experiences have brought me to a level where I can contribute to product definition, system architecture from hardware to networked system integration with a holistic and in-depth view of various parts of the system stack. Thus this blog where I note down what I explore at various avenues of my “tech-life”.

Some of my favorite pastimes include carpentry, tinkering with PCB design and building utility boards, python programming, tech evangelism at university levels, and learning.

You can find a detailed list of my professional experiences on my [Curriculum Vitae page](/cv).
