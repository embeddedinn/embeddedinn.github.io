Embeddedinn is the place where I keep a tab on the technical tinkering and professional work that I do on a day to day basis. It is more of a journal of activities than a full fledged tutorial site. However, I try to put in as many details as possible so that it will benefit others trying to do something similar. 

Visit the tutorials page to access my in-depth <a href="/tutorials/">tutorials</a> on various technical topics.
