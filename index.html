Embeddedinn is the place where I keep a tab on the technical tinkering and professional work that I do on a day to day basis. It is more of a journal of activities than a full fledged tutorial site. However, I try to put in as many details as possible so that it will benefit others trying to do something similar. 

Visit the <a href="/tutorials/">tutorials</a> page to access my in-depth write-ups on various technical topics. 

<p/>
You can also find some more content that I have developed in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1rx0Zwpvd2hRQbQWSEpSrQ" target="_blank">youtube channel.<i aria-hidden="true" style="color: Tomato;" class="fab fa-fw fa-youtube"></i><a/>
