message: "Very cool your article. I am new at decoding part of SSL / TLS protocols. I'm more specialized in Hardwares. Today I live in Brazil and work in a large hospital in the emanutanção part of medical equipment. Four months ago, the company that monitored the technical parameters of our equipment online was bankrupt. The company did not share the secret encryption key so we could make our monitoring portal leverage the technology that has been paid in the past. The Hardware monitors the technical parameters of our equipment and every 3 hours it connected to an external server and sent the encrypted data to a portal where we followed everything. Now we need to get the customer data and decode. We have the Master key of the Server, and the certificate.\r\nWe have nothing from the client and we do not have the secret key either.\r\nDo you know how we can proceed?\r\nthanks"
